# Ethical Hacking Career Roadmap - Overview

This project presents an interactive and visually-driven career roadmap for individuals aspiring to enter or advance in the field of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. It consolidates key knowledge areas, certifications, job roles, and learning strategies into an accessible and modern web interface.

## What This Website Contains:

### 1. Interactive Career Visualization

*   **Vis.js Network Graph:** The central feature is a dynamic and interactive network diagram that visually maps out the complex landscape of an ethical hacking career.
    *   **Nodes:** Represent individual skills (categorized as Foundational, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert), crucial industry Certifications, and potential Job Roles within cybersecurity.
    *   **Edges:** Illustrate dependencies and natural progression paths between skills, certifications, and job opportunities.
    *   **Interactivity:** Users can pan, zoom, and drag nodes to explore relationships and organize their view of the roadmap.

### 2. Clear Legend

*   A dedicated "Legend" section provides a key to understanding the network graph. It explains the color-coding and distinct shapes used for different categories of nodes (e.g., green for Foundational Skills, blue for Basic Skills, hexagons for Job Roles, diamonds for Certifications).

### 3. Structured Learning Path

*   **Accordion Sections:** The "Recommended Learning Path" is broken down into four expandable/collapsible accordion sections:
    *   **Phase 1: Foundational & Basic:** Covers core IT concepts, basic security principles, and initial certifications.
    *   **Phase 2: Intermediate Specialization:** Focuses on areas like web security, network security, cryptography, and basic cloud/mobile security.
    *   **Phase 3: Advanced Deep Dive:** Explores complex topics such as malware analysis, reverse engineering, exploit development, and enterprise security.
    *   **Phase 4: Expert & Research:** Deals with cutting-edge areas like zero-day discovery, advanced forensics, IoT/OT security, and security research.
*   Each phase provides bullet-point lists of specific skills, technologies, and relevant certifications, often with estimated timeframes.

### 4. Certifications Path Overview

*   A concise summary of key industry certifications, organized by proficiency level (Foundational/Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert), offering guidance on professional qualifications.

### 5. Crucial Soft Skills

*   Highlights the non-technical but equally vital skills necessary for success in ethical hacking, including ethics, problem-solving, communication, continuous learning, attention to detail, and teamwork.

### 6. Recommended Learning Resources

*   A curated list of diverse learning materials and platforms to support the journey, such as:
    *   Online platforms (e.g., TryHackMe, Hack The Box, PortSwigger Web Security Academy)
    *   Seminal books
    *   Capture The Flag (CTF) events
    *   Guidance on building a home lab
    *   Community forums and events
    *   Open-source project contributions

### 7. Modern User Interface

*   **Glassmorphism Design:** The website features a contemporary "glassmorphism" aesthetic with translucent, blurred background elements, giving it a sleek and sophisticated look.
*   **Dynamic Dark/Light Mode:** A prominent toggle switch in the header allows users to switch between a clean light theme and a high-contrast dark theme. The theme preference is saved to the browser's local storage for persistence. All UI elements, including the colors within the Vis.js graph, dynamically adapt to the chosen theme.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The design is optimized to provide a good user experience across various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
*   **Typography:** Uses the 'Poppins' font for a modern and readable visual presentation.
